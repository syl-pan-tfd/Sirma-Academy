    <p>Washington [US], June 13 (ANI): Who can forget Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio-starrer 'Titanic', which was released in 1997. The stunning actor recalled the shooting for a romantic 'I'm flying' scene with Leonardo, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
    <p>The audience loved the on-screen chemistry between Leonardo's character Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet's charming role of Rose DeWitt Bukater. The two represented completely different classes.</p>
    <p>The 'I'm flying' is an iconic scene from the film in which Jack and Rose are standing on the bow of the ship with their hands wide open.</p>
    <p>Kate looked back and remembered filming a sequence in which her character Ross kisses DiCaprio's Jack.</p>
